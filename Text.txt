INTRODUCTION
Road traffic accident is a major problem worldwide resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Advanced driver assistance systems are one of the salient features of intelligent systems in transportation. They improve vehicle safety by providing real-time traffic information to the driver. Road signs play an important role in road safety.
Smart roadway signage is not simply an objective for the future. Two UK companies have collaborated to produce these signs for use on England’s roads. The signs are technologically advanced, with graphics and text that drivers can see clearly. The messages are easy to comprehend quickly, keeping drivers informed of route conditions as they change. In addition to enhancing the roadway experience for users, this new signage costs less to maintain than traditional indicators. The new signs require fewer materials and less cabling, resulting in less time, upkeep, and expense.
Increasing volumes of traffic are using municipal road infrastructure, with severe consequences for traffic efficiency and the safety of road users. Vulnerable roads users (VRUs), such as pedestrians or cyclists, are involved in 46 % of lethal accidents. Exchanging information between road users increases their perception and is thus a critical building block to improve this situation. We have presented a system, to alert the driver about the speed limits in specific areas and reduce the speed of the vehicles in sensitive public zones without any interference of the drivers where controls are taken automatically by the use of a wireless local area networks.
